*A website using HTML5 and CSS3*

```
Status: Almost finished

## Description
Development and creation of a website with the purpose of simulating a customer order. Simple pages were made in order to make the site attractive and functional. The texts and contents of the site are not the focus for me. 

At the time I was developing this project, I hadn't had much contact with these languages. Currently I could improve some things but I decided to leave it as is to remember where I came from and how I started.

A responsive media is not complete.
